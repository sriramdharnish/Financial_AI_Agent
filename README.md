# Financial_AI_Agent


## 🧠 Project Overview
This repository explores the design and application of an Agentic AI system in the financial domain. The goal is to demonstrate how autonomous, goal-driven agents can manage, analyze, and optimize financial workflows with minimal human intervention.

## 🚀 Features
* __Autonomous Decision Making:__ The agent can independently analyze financial data and take informed actions.

* __Multi-Agent Collaboration:__ Supports coordination between different specialized agents for tasks like risk analysis, investment allocation, and reporting.

* __Natural Language Interfaces:__ Allows users to interact with the agent using plain English for queries and commands.

* __Plug-and-Play Financial APIs:__ Integrates with various financial data sources and trading platforms.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
* __Language Models:__ OpenAI GPT-based agents

* __Framework:__ Phidata

* __Data Access:__ Financial APIs (e.g., DuckDuckGo, Yahoo Finance)

* __Orchestration:__ Python scripts and agent toolkits

## 🏦 Use Cases
- Portfolio optimization and rebalancing

- Automated report generation

- Financial data analysis and forecasting

- Real-time market monitoring and alerts

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Add reinforcement learning for adaptive strategies

- Enhance multi-agent negotiation capabilities

- Expand integration to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms
